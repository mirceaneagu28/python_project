I show below which .py file is associated for each point.

1. I created get_data_api.py in order to get data and save data into a .json file
   Then in file insert_into_sqlite_tables.py I insert data into 3 sqlite tables created

2. In database_operations.py can be found some SQL queries in python script

3. For pandas manipulations I created pandas_operations.py (3.a + 3.b)

4.a - interactions_between_tables.py
4.b - generate_report.py
